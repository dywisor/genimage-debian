Description: tool to generate multiple filesystem and flash images from a tree
 genimage is a tool to generate multiple filesystem
 and flash/disk images from a given root filesystem tree.
 genimage is intended to be run in a fakeroot environment.
 It also supports creating flash/disk images
 out of different file-system images and files.
 .
 Configuration is done in a config file parsed by libconfuse.
 Options like the path to tools can be given via environment variables,
 the config file or from commandline switches.
